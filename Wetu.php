<p class="paragraph" id="small_tittle">Our Role</p>
<p class="paragraph">We worked closely with Weu to build their brand profile, providing the necessary direction, structure and language to define their brand and 
purpose.</p>

<p class="paragraph" id="small_tittle">Outcomes</p>    
<p class="paragraph">
                This incorporated strategic advice on brand positioning and guidance through a renaming process. Once completed we moved into 
development of a new visual identity that captured the multiple facets of the brand in one striking logo design. Finally, we created all the 
company collaterals and conducted location and product branding as well as videography and photography production showcasing their 
various projects.
                    </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                WeTu has established itself as a key service provider in the communities in which it operates and is delivering on its objectives with reliability 
and professionalism. By developing a strong and well defined brand and purpose for Wetu, the company has been able to deliver its services 
effectively, with a clear direction and vision. The WeTu name and brand elements have become distinctive features within the communities and
