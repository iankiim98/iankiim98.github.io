<p class="paragraph" id="small_tittle">Our Role</p>
<p class="paragraph">Following investment into Blowplast, we were engaged to deliver a full rebrand of the business, with the requirement to craft a new direction, 
language and value system that would fundamentally change the brand and business positioning and prepare Blowplast for the future of 
plastics manufacturing. To achieve this we built a new brand from the ground up, introducing a simple but powerful brand promise - ‘Built for 
the Future’. From this underpinning foundation we crafted new values, vision, mission and all visual identity elements, including interior design 
and branding of the factory and office space. This established a new company culture and commitment that meant Blowplast would be able 
to grow and ad</p>

<p class="paragraph" id="small_tittle">Outcomes</p>   
                <p class="paragraph">Blowplast is now positioned as the market leader in social responsibility within the plastics manufacturing sector in Kenya. The implementation 
of a new philosophy and operational processes that deliver more efficient, productive and positive outcomes for the business, staff and the 
wider environment has been made possible through the committed adoption of the new brand culture and promise.
